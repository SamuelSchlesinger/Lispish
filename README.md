Lispish language... Here are the facts.

0. There is no specification

1. Programs consist of a series of top level definitions

2. There's a funky hack that will automatically curry things for you

3. You can include other files via "include = (...)"

4. Numbers are encoded as Church numerals

5. It is bound to be incredibly slow on trivial programs.

6. I'm having a lot of fun playing with this.

If you want an example you can look in the Prelude.
